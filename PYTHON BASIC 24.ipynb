    "Ans. Keyword def that marks the start of the function header. A function name to uniquely identify the function. Function naming follows the same rules of writing identifiers in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambdas are one-line methods without a name or we can say anonymous Func They work practically the same as any other method in Python Lambdas differ from normal Python methods because they can have only one expression, can't contain any statements and their return type is a function object"
